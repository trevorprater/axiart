# axiart - Code Diagram Philosophy

## Codebase Analysis

This diagram visualizes the structure of the **axiart** codebase:

- **14 source files** analyzed
- **1,646 total lines of code**
- **0 dependencies** mapped
- **1 directories** identified

## Visualization Strategy

### Layout Algorithm: Force-Directed

The spatial arrangement uses **force-directed** layout, which positions files based on their relationships:
- Central positions → Highly connected modules
- Peripheral positions → Leaf nodes and utilities
- Spatial proximity → Related functionality

### Visual Encoding

**Files → Circles**
Each source file is represented as a circle, with radius proportional to √(LOC). This square-root scaling ensures visual balance—large files don't dominate the composition.

**Dependencies → Lines**
Thin gray lines connect files that import or require each other, revealing the dependency graph structure.

**Complexity → Concentric**
The most complex files (top 10% by LOC) are highlighted with concentric—subtle visual cues suggesting internal structure without overwhelming the composition.

## Aesthetic Choices

### Geometric Elegance (70%)

The foundation is pure geometry: circles, lines, sparse grid. This creates immediate readability—you can grasp the system structure at a glance.

### Algorithmic Whispers (30%)

Strategic use of concentric adds depth without chaos. These subtle patterns reward sustained viewing, hinting at the complexity hidden within the geometric scaffolding.

### Restraint & Negative Space

- **Total marks**: ~60 (target: 3,000-8,000)
- **Negative space**: ~50% (target: 40%+)
- **Color palette**: Black + blue accent for entry points
- **Grid substrate**: Sparse coordinate system for reference

The composition breathes. Empty space is not waste—it's essential for clarity.

## Design Philosophy

> "Code is invisible architecture. We make it visible through geometric translation, not literal representation."

This diagram doesn't show every file or every dependency. It shows the **essential structure**: the skeleton of the system, the critical relationships, the zones of complexity.

It's meant to be:
- **Immediately readable**: Understand the structure at a glance
- **Studyably deep**: Discover details on closer inspection
- **Aesthetically refined**: Beautiful enough to frame
- **Technically accurate**: Reflects actual code relationships
